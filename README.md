Ken Stone looking through my old SC stuff I have come across the Protel PCB file for the TEC-1C, I guess Peter must have given it to me. I also have a PCB file for something called the MYCOMP dated 060690...

Interesting. I haven't seen that one before.

Ken Stone Mmmm. not yours? Have a look at all the stuff on it! I know Peter had a lot of people doing kits for him, could it be Jim's?

Craig Jones That could be possible. I vaguely recall Colin telling me that Jim was doing computer stuff for Peter, and for the longest time thought it was Jim behind the SC. Of course we are talking about ancient memories. I didn't do any Protel stuff for Colin before Electronics For Model Railways Vol 2.
There was another odd-ball TE computer that I think Paul did, but it used a different CPU. The 1C art was done by Craig Hart.
